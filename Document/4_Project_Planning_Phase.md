# 4. Project Planning Phase

## Project Scope
- **In Scope:** Develop web app for blood cell classification using transfer learning, including model training, frontend, backend, and basic deployment.
- **Out of Scope:** Advanced features like multi-language support, integration with EHR systems.

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Ideation):** Week 1 - Completed.
- **Phase 2 (Requirements):** Week 2 - Completed.
- **Phase 3 (Design):** Week 3 - Completed.
- **Phase 4 (Planning):** Week 4 - Current.
- **Phase 5 (Development):** Weeks 5-8.
  - Model Training: Weeks 5-6.
  - Backend Development: Week 7.
  - Frontend Development: Week 8.
- **Phase 6 (Testing):** Weeks 9-10.
- **Phase 7 (Documentation/Demo):** Week 11.

## Resources Needed
- **Team:** 1 Developer (AI/ML, Web Dev).
- **Hardware:** PC with GPU for training.
- **Software:** Python, TensorFlow, Flask, VS Code.
- **Dataset:** Kaggle "Blood Cell Images" dataset (12,000 blood cell images).

## Risk Management
- **Risk 1:** Model accuracy low.
  - Mitigation: Use transfer learning, validate on test set.
- **Risk 2:** Deployment issues.
  - Mitigation: Test locally first, use cloud if needed.
- **Risk 3:** Data privacy.
  - Mitigation: Implement security measures.

## Budget
- **Estimated Cost:** $500 (cloud credits, if any).
- **Breakdown:** Software licenses free, hardware existing.

## Milestones
- Model trained and evaluated.
- Web app functional.
- Testing completed.
- Documentation finalized.
